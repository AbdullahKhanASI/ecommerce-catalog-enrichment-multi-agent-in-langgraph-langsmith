# E-commerce Catalog Enrichment & SEO Writer – Delivery Plan

## Vision & KPIs
- Deliver enriched, channel-ready product listings by normalizing attributes, filling gaps, and writing localized SEO copy that meets marketplace requirements.
- KPIs: attribute coverage ≥ 98%, validation precision ≥ 97%, SEO copy acceptance ≥ 95%, throughput ≥ 500 SKUs/hour with < 5% human rework rate.

## System Overview
- Multi-agent workflow built with LangGraph on top of LangChain abstractions, orchestrated by a Supervisor capable of map-reduce fan-out across SKU batches and fan-in merge of normalized payloads.
- Agents run as deterministic graph nodes with retry policies, per-SKU state persistence, and human-in-the-loop interrupt paths for low-confidence outcomes.
- Integrations: feed ingress adapters, enrichment knowledge stores, localization assets, PIM publisher, LangSmith for tracing, Langfuse for analytics.

## Agent Topology
1. **Supervisor** – splits inbound SKU batches, seeds thread state, schedules Attribute Extractor runs in parallel, merges downstream results, persists checkpoints, escalates low-confidence cases for QA.
2. **Attribute Extractor** – normalizes categorical & numeric attributes, leverages attribute schema registry, flags missing/ambiguous fields, emits confidence scores.
3. **Validator/De-duper** – cross-checks extracted attributes against schemas & historical catalog, deduplicates near-identical SKUs, enforces business rules.
4. **SEO Copywriter** – crafts channel-specific SEO title, bullet points, descriptions; tunes verbosity by locale; tags copy with tone/style metadata.
5. **Localizer** – localizes copy and attribute labels per locale; uses glossary & fallback translation memories; confirms legal/compliance requirements.
6. **Publisher** – pushes enriched SKU payloads back to PIM/API, records job status, schedules retries, and notifies downstream systems.

## Data Flow & State Management
- Ingestion adapters produce raw SKU envelopes → Supervisor seeds LangGraph threads with SKU payload + context.
- Attribute Extractor populates normalized attribute map; intermediate state persisted in vector/JSON store keyed by SKU thread ID for retries.
- Validator/De-duper updates status flags (valid, duplicate, needs_QA). Low-confidence paths trigger human QA tasks with stored conversation context.
- SEO Copywriter consumes validated attributes, writes channel-specific messaging, emits evaluation metrics (readability, keyword density).
- Localizer expands copy to locales, referencing localization memory and compliance rules.
- Publisher consolidates final payload, pushes to PIM, emits events for observability and Langfuse metrics.

## Technology & Infrastructure
- **Core**: Python, LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, Langfuse, Redis/SQLite (prototype) → Postgres + object storage (production).
- **Knowledge sources**: Attribute schema registry (YAML/JSON), product taxonomy embeddings (vector DB), localization glossaries.
- **Messaging**: Async task queue (Celery/RQ) for batch execution; optional streaming feed ingestion via webhooks.
- **Deployment**: Containerized services (Docker), orchestration via ECS/Kubernetes, CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

## Persistence Strategy
- Thread state store keyed by SKU thread ID (JSON documents capturing agent outputs, confidence, audit trail) for deterministic retries & human QA.
- Embedding/vector store for attribute/value similarity and de-dup heuristics.
- Relational DB for job metadata, throughput metrics, human QA assignments.

## Observability & Analytics
- LangSmith traces per agent execution, linked to thread IDs for replay.
- Langfuse metrics capturing latency, tokens, quality scores, success/failure counts; dashboards to highlight regressions across agent graphs.
- Structured logging with correlation IDs per SKU; alerts on throughput drops or queue backlogs.

## Repository Layout (proposed)
- `src/` – application code
  - `agents/` – individual agent node implementations
  - `supervisor/` – orchestration logic & map-reduce utilities
  - `pipelines/` – graph definitions & data flow wiring
  - `adapters/` – feed ingestion & PIM publishing connectors
  - `state/` – persistence layer, thread stores, vector DB abstractions
  - `services/` – async workers, scheduler, API endpoints
  - `telemetry/` – LangSmith/Langfuse integration helpers
- `configs/` – environment, agent prompts, schema registry
- `tests/` – unit, integration, regression suites
- `docs/` – technical documentation, playbooks
- `scripts/` – dev tooling, data loaders

## Milestones & Deliverables
1. **Phase 0 – Foundations (Week 1)**: Requirements alignment, schema contracts, repo scaffolding, CI bootstrap.
2. **Phase 1 – Data & Supervisor (Weeks 2-3)**: Ingestion adapters, thread persistence, Supervisor map-reduce MVP, LangSmith tracing baseline.
3. **Phase 2 – Core Agents (Weeks 3-5)**: Attribute Extractor & Validator with evaluation harness & tests, SEO Copywriter prompts, Localizer integration.
4. **Phase 3 – Publishing & QA (Weeks 5-6)**: Publisher connector, human QA interrupt flows, retry/resume mechanics, Langfuse dashboards.
5. **Phase 4 – Hardening (Weeks 6-7)**: Load tests, red-team copy quality, monitoring, runbooks, production readiness review.

## Testing & QA Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Attribute parsers, schema validators, localization formatters, prompt templating.
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end SKU thread walkthrough via LangGraph, map-reduce fan-out/in, PIM publishing handshake.
- **Evaluation harness**: Offline scoring sets for attribute accuracy, SEO copy scores, localization QA metrics.
- **Regression tests**: Golden datasets for localization & dedupe to catch prompt drift.
- **Observability tests**: Ensure LangSmith traces & Langfuse metrics emit expected fields; simulate failure modes.

## Deployment & Operations
- Staging & production environments with feature flags for agents.
- Rollout using canary batches; automatic rollback if failure rate > threshold.
- Runbooks for retrying stuck threads, clearing dead letter queues, engaging human QA backlog.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **LLM drift** → Establish prompt versioning, regression datasets, automated monitoring.
- **Data quality variance** → Build schema registry & heuristics to route low-confidence SKUs to human QA early.
- **Throughput bottlenecks** → Horizontal scale via Supervisor map-reduce, async workers, caching of attribute lookups.
- **Localization compliance** → Maintain legal glossary, enforce review workflows, fall back to human linguists for flagged locales.
